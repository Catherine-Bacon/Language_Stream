// NOTE: The JSON interception logic has been REMOVED.
// Subtitle URL capture is now handled reliably by the 'webRequest' API
// in background.js, which is the preferred method for extensions 
// to monitor network traffic.

// This file can safely be empty or removed entirely, but it is kept 
// here to avoid breaking manifest references if you only update files.
